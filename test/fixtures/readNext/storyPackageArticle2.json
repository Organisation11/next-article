The large number of offices makes it “easy for irregularities to happen and cause problems,” it said.</p>\n<p>China’s anti-corruption watchdog had said after an audit earlier this year that CNPC had “too many offices and hotels” and “chaotic management” among other issues.</p>\n<p>Beijing’s anti-corruption drive has disproportionately affected CNPC, a former power base for Zhou Yongkang, the now-disgraced energy and security tsar. A former member of the standing committee of the politburo, Mr Zhou is the highest-ranking Communist Party member to be arrested in Xi Jinping’s anti-corruption crackdown and power consolidation.</p>\n<p>His influence thrived in CNPC’s Soluxe hotel chain, where his son Zhou Bin muscled in on hotel properties including one in the Sichuan mountain resort area of Jiuzhaigou. Soluxe operates more than 30 hotels in two dozen Chinese cities, as well as a taxi company in Beijing and a travel agency.</p>\n<p>Mr Zhou’s relatives had also encroached on CNPC oil projects overseas.</p>\n<p>The anti-corruption watchdog’s report on CNPC vowed to “resolutely eradicate the malignant influence of Zhou Yongkang and others”.</p>\n<aside data-asset-type=\"promoBox\" data-asset-name=\"asset1\"></aside><p>Also over the weekend, state oil company Cnooc pledged to “dismantle all entertainment equipment” and ban official receptions, dining, and purchases of high-end liquor and cigarettes.</p>\n<p>Chinese SOEs, government ministries and provincial governments generally own a number of hotels and representative offices in Beijing as well as in other large Chinese cities, much as a US state might have a business development office in Washington DC. Many also own hotels overseas or in resort areas in China, in part to host the executive and employee trips that are a perk of working for the Chinese state. They also operate old-age homes for elderly and retired cadres or executives.</p>\n\n<p>Oil groups and mining companies first developed hotels near oilfields and mines during the planned economy, and many morphed into freewheeling side businesses after China allowed a market economy to develop. But the businesses became a channel for corruption and nepotism for officials running the enterprises.</p>\n\n<p><span class=\"ft-italic\">Additional reporting by Owen Guo in Beijing</span>\n</p>"
