It will give Chinese companies flexibility in terms of timing and the amount of bonds issued as long as it is within the approved foreign debt quota,” said Ivan Chung, head of greater China credit research at Moody’s in Hong Kong. </p>\n<p>Previously, companies needed approval on a deal-by-deal basis but now they are only required to register with the regulator. “Like Shanghai-HK Stock Connect, it is another step forward in integrating the Chinese financial market with the world,” Mr Chung said. </p>\n\n<p>China’s foreign exchange reserves fell 2.6 per cent to $3.557tn in August, a monthly <a title=\"China’s foreign exchange reserves fall by record $94bn - FT.com\" href=\"http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/2d3eb83e-554d-11e5-8642-453585f2cfcd.html#axzz3lsE9hDZv\">$94bn</a> drop that was the sharpest on record, as the People’s Bank of China sold down some of its stockpile to support the renminbi. </p>\n<p>​Data from the Bank of International Settlements show that foreign bank claims on China shrank by $77bn in the first three months of 2015, reflecting their reluctance to lend and Chinese borrowers’ increasing wariness of taking on foreign currency debt. </p>\n<p>“On one level it’s encouraging to see that China has not lost its appetite for pro-market liberalisation, even as volatility and uncertainty have risen. It suggests the leadership understands that problems revealed by market forces can be addressed by market forces as well,” says Michael Kurtz, chief Asia equity strategist at Nomura in Hong Kong.</p>\n<p>However, he said it was not clear that Chinese firms would immediately embrace the more open overseas borrowing environment, “given expectations for both a depreciating renminbi and for rising US dollar borrowing costs vs falling domestic borrowing costs”. Markets are awaiting a decision from the US Federal Reserve on Thursday on whether to raise interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade. </p>\n<p>The NDRC also said it would encourage companies with good credit quality and strong debt repayment ability to raise money overseas for high-priority construction and investment projects such as the “One Belt, One Road” campaign to develop ties along the old Silk Road trading route. </p>\n<p>Meanwhile, China is considering implementing restrictions on automated trading in its commodity markets, according to market participants who spoke to the FT.</p>\n<p>The new regulations would define automated traders, require their identity and source of funds to be disclosed and limit the number of trades they could place in the futures markets. </p>\n<p>“A few years ago the exchanges began researching this type of unified management because programme trading is different from other trading behaviour and can cause shocks,” said one exchange official who did not want to be named. “After the August 16 crash, this discussion has sprung up again.”</p>\n<p><span class=\"ft-italic\">Additional reporting by Jackie Cai and Lucy Hornby</span>\n</p>"

The so-called \"national team\" of state financial institutions directed many trades through the brokerage's flagship trading hall in Beijing.</p>\n<p>Police are investigating Chen Boming, Citic’s general manager, Yu Xinli, operations management head, and Wang Jinling, vice director of information technology, on allegations in connection with insider trading and the leak of inside information, the official Xinhua news agency said late on Tuesday.</p>\n<p>In late August, eight Citic executives and board members were <a title=\"China launches probes into top brokerages - FT.com\" href=\"http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/ada9ca96-4bab-11e5-b558-8a9722977189.html\">taken into custody</a>. Four of them were later punished for insider trading. The three latest arrests deal a further blow to the company, whose stock price has fallen 61 per cent since the height of China's broader market rally in early June.</p>\n<p>In mid-July, as the government was deploying trillions of renminbi in state rescue funds to stem the panic in the Shanghai and Shenzhen markets, Mr. Chen gave an interview to Caijing, a respected financial magazine in which he pledged the broker would do its part to stabilise the market. </p>\n<p>Detailed allegations against Mr Chen and other Citic executives are not public, but the company is the government's favoured brokerage and may have had information about which stocks state institutions were buying. </p>\n<p>Traders say <a title=\"FT Explainer: What is China Securities Finance Corporation? - FT.com\" href=\"http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/c1666694-248b-11e5-9c4e-a775d2b173ca.html\">China Securities Finance Corp</a>, the state-owned margin lending agency that became the government's main conduit for injecting rescue funds into the market, was known to route trades through Citic.
