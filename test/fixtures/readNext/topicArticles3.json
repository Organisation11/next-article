The mood, among Greeks as well as those who follow the country from outside, is one of resignation.</p>\n<p>Notwithstanding this, the process of learning the lessons of the Greek debt crisis is fortunately continuing apace, the latest instalment being a <a title=\"Fall 2015 Brookings Panel on Economic Activity - brookings.edu\" href=\"http://www.brookings.edu/about/projects/bpea/latest-conference\">series of papers</a> presented at last week’s Brookings Panel on Economic Activity conference.</p>\n<p>The most captivating of these papers is a <a title=\"The pitfalls of external independence: Greece, 1829-2015 - brookings.edu\" href=\"http://www.brookings.edu/about/projects/bpea/papers/2015/reinhart-trebesch-greek-debt-crisis\">historical study of Greece’s history</a> with external debt. There is nothing new about the country’s current debt travails, write Carmen Reinhart and Christoph Trebesch. It took on huge foreign loans in order to fund its war for independence and thus started its existence as a modern state with a large debt burden. Brutal episodes of external indebtedness followed by debilitating debt overhangs and default happened in the 1820s, 1880s, 1920s and again today.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" width=\"600\" src=\"http://im.ft-static.com/content/images/2d739d5c-5c68-11e5-a28b-50226830d644.png\"/>\n</p>\n<p>The fascinating study illustrates how <a title=\"Eurozone: The case against ‘cash for reform’ - FT.com\" href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/9ef2a034-458b-11e5-af2f-4d6e0e5eda22.html\">the euro has taken too much blame for the current misery</a>: experience suggests Greece would easily have incurred excessive debt in the 2000s boom whether or not it was a member of the single currency. And the problems that followed echo those of past debt disasters and the responses to them:</p>\n<p>“Against this backdrop, the most recent round of Greek sovereign bailouts and the associated conditionality by the ‘Troika’ of IMF, ECB and European Commission look familiar as to the timing, the process and the associated political disputes. As debt migrated from private sector balance sheets to official sector balance sheets, Greece was pushed to give up parts of its sovereignty and to implement adjustment programmes to which it did not fully agree. The success of these interventions was often limited.”</p>\n<p>That limited success is the topic of some of the other papers. Yannis Ioannides and Christopher Pissarides ask “Is the Greek debt crisis one of supply or demand?” <a title=\"Is the Greek debt crisis one of supply or demand? - brookings.edu\" href=\"http://www.brookings.edu/about/projects/bpea/papers/2015/ioannides-pissarides-greek-debt-crisis\">Their answer is that it is both</a>, and that the policy programme often made things worse by missing the complexity of the economic challenge. They are particularly critical of pushing so hard on socially disruptive labour market liberalisation instead of prioritising product markets:</p>\n<p>“The Greek economy is subject to more frictions and is less open than other EZ economies in crisis, such as Ireland and Portugal. In such an economy prices do not fall and the decrease in aggregate demand that is brought about by wage decreases translates into a contraction of aggregate activity and unemployment . . . Wage reductions were reflected in greater increases in profit margins rather than reductions in prices [and] have contributed to the recession instead of reversing it. In such circumstances it makes much more sense to target first product market reforms . . . Labour markets reforms were given greater priority, mistakenly in our view.”</p>\n<p>Ioannides and Pissarides, additionally, point out that product market reforms carry better prospects for higher productivity growth in the long run, Greece’s deepest economic need. This echoes the IMF research we have written about earlier, which shows that <a title=\"The good, the bad, and the ugly in structural reform - Free Lunch - FT.com\" href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/e9c6e16e-e349-11e4-9a82-00144feab7de.html\">not all structural reforms are created equal</a> — and indeed that the IMF’s own teams on the ground do not always press for the best ones.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" width=\"600\" src=\"http://im.ft-static.com/content/images/20bee9f2-4653-11e5-b3b2-1672f710807b.img\"/>\n</p>\n<p><span class=\"ft-bold\">Will she or won’t she?</span>\n</p>\n<p>The Federal Reserve’s interest-rate-setting committee meets today and will announce tomorrow whether it is indeed going to start lifting rates now. Arguments for or against a rise — mostly against — have been piling up and it may be a good time to quiet down and just wait to see what happens. But two recent contributions in the FT are well worth reading. One is from Larry Summers, who seems to have appointed himself dovish-commentators-in-chief. In a short note, he says that apart from the big substantial reasons why it would be wrong to lift the rate, <a title=\"Monetary policy should seek to avoid major surprises - blogs.ft.com\" href=\"http://blogs.ft.com/larry-summers/2015/09/15/75/\">there is also a tactical reason to wait</a>: by now markets only expect a rise with a 28 per cent probability, so even if the Fed wants to increase rates, it has not guided investors to expect this outcome. The last time it started a tightening cycle against expectations was 1994, and what followed has been called the “bond market massacre”.</p>\n<p>Also read Gavyn Davies’s <a title=\"Janet Yellen's fateful decision - blogs.ft.com\" href=\"http://blogs.ft.com/gavyndavies/2015/09/15/janet-yellens-fateful-decision/\">more strategic observations</a> on Fed chair Janet Yellen’s decision (for it largely comes down to her now). “From where I sit, it is hard to say that these key criteria [that Yellen has publicly announced] have been met today, unless they were already met in July, when the Fed decided not to raise rates,” he writes. It emerges that a key strategic mistake was for Yellen to have introduced “calendar-based” guidance when she said in July she expected a rate rise “later this year”. She may have been throwing a bone to the hawks on her committee. But it has not made Fed policy thinking any clearer.</p>\n<p><span class=\"ft-bold\">Numbers news</span>\n</p>\n<ul><li>The Economist reports on a study showing that annoying as they may have been, <a title=\"Why tube strikes help Londoners - economist.com\" href=\"http://www.economist.com/blogs/freeexchange/2015/09/economics-commuting\">London tube strikes helped commuters</a> find travel routes that were better than before.

Chief among them will be implementing a tough reform package Athens committed to as part of an €86bn bailout agreed in July to stave of bankruptcy.</p>\n<aside data-asset-type=\"promoBox\" data-asset-name=\"asset1\"></aside><p>“The next government needs more than just enough seats. It needs the legitimacy from the vast majority of voters in order to have the security and certainty of three or four years that Greece needs to move forward,” said George Koumoutsakos, the party’s foreign policy head.</p>\n<p>“It makes sense for us to work together. You can only meet these challenges with national unity. We need to do whatever we can to put the country back on track,” Mr Koumoutsakos told the FT.</p>\n<p>Mr Tsipras has repeatedly rebuffed such offers, and in a televised debate on Monday evening told Mr Meimarakis that any deal between the two parties after the election would be “unnatural”. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thanos Veremis, a Greek historian and political commentator, said of the debate: “It was entertaining and interesting but it is unlikely to decide the election outcome. Meimarakis had a better grasp of arguments and policy details but Tsipras was able to put him on the defensive.”</p>\n<p>The final few days of campaigning will see both parties target a large proportion of undecided voters, while Mr Tsipras faces a battle to convince his party faithful that he can still be trusted, despite seemingly reneging on his promise to end austerity by signing up to the bailout and reform programme.</p>\n<p>Ilias, a stockbroker who followed the debate from a café in the upmarket Kolonaki neighbourhood, said: “You have to admire his [Tsipras’s] chutzpah even if his policies didn’t work.”<a title=\"Canadian miner and Greek minister clash over projects - FT.com\" href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/d2ba2702-d853-11e4-ba53-00144feab7de.htmlaxzz3lhwmT7bi\"></a>\n</p>\n<p>One subject that figured into the debate was the investment by Eldorado Gold of Canada in a depressed region of northern Greece, which leftwingers oppose even though the country’s supreme court has ruled that environmental permits are in line with international standards. </p>\n\n<p>Mr Meimarakis made a point of bringing up the gold mining controversy in the debate, saying: “Syriza claims it wants investments to create jobs but you put thousands of jobs at risk just to score electoral points. You are driving away growth, not creating it”.</p>\n<p>An unruffled Mr Tsipras replied: “We only want investment that won’t damage the environment.”</p>\n"
