The short answer is pretty much everything. Investments that were shut out a few years ago are now admissible, and by the end of this year it should be possible <a title=\"Peer-to-peer platforms expect Isa delay - FT.com\" href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/28be0c30-70e5-11e4-85d5-00144feabdc0.html?siteedition=uk\">to add peer-to-peer lending</a> to Isas too.</p>\n<p>The increased flexibility of the Isa wrapper, combined with the higher investment limit, have created new opportunities for consolidating investments held elsewhere.</p>\n<p>The most obvious of these is <a title=\"Investors should Aim for the right shares - FT.com\" href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/58770b02-0020-11e3-9c40-00144feab7de.html\">shares traded on Aim</a>, London’s market for less mature companies. The government remained opposed to admitting these into Isas for almost 14 years before an abrupt <span class=\"ft-italic\">volte-face</span> in 2013.</p>\n<p>However, according to Peter Day at Killik, there has not been a stampede to transfer. “We run Aim IHT portfolios and there has been some consolidation of Isas into these. But the appetite for Aim shares is at a low ebb generally.”</p>\n<p>Corporate bonds with less than five years to maturity at the time of purchase were also barred from Isas. That restriction was abolished in the Budget last year, meaning virtually any qualifying corporate bond can now be placed in an Isa. The exception is “mini-bonds”, which are fixed-term loans to a company; these aren’t admissible because there is no secondary market. </p>\n<p>The process of transferring assets held elsewhere into Isas is fairly convoluted, however. It’s not possible to simply move holdings from a non-Isa platform or account into an Isa; the holdings must be sold first, then immediately repurchased inside the Isa.</p>\n<aside data-asset-type=\"promoBox\" data-asset-name=\"asset1\"></aside><p>Many brokers will do this for you in a transaction known as “<a title=\"Top tips to cut your tax bill - FT.com\" href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/7fe14cac-6873-11e1-a6cc-00144feabdc0.html\">bed and Isa</a>” — a variation on the old “bed and breakfast” trade, whereby investments were sold at the very end of one tax year and then immediately repurchased at the start of the next to manage capital gains tax liabilities. Bed and breakfasting was outlawed in 1998.</p>\n<p>But there is a cost, especially for investments that trade on stock markets such as shares, investment trusts and exchange-traded funds. Typically, the broker will only charge commission on one “half” of the bed-and-Isa trade — either the sale, or the purchase – but you will always be liable for stamp duty at 0.5 per cent on the purchase costs. You are likely to lose out slightly on the difference between buying and selling prices, and selling shares outside an Isa could also trigger a capital gains tax liability. </p>\n<p>It may also make sense to bring shares granted or purchased under <a title=\"SAYE allowances double - FT.com\" href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/f6db20a6-ba5d-11e3-8b15-00144feabdc0.html\">employee share ownership schemes</a> within an Isa. These are often held with a registrar such as Equiniti or Computershare. They don’t provide shelter from tax and large awards could trigger a capital gains tax event, while higher-rate taxpayers will face additional income tax on any dividends.</p>\n<p>Shares purchased under a save as you earn scheme can be moved into an Isa free of capital gains tax — and without using the bed-and-Isa process so long as the transaction is effected within 90 days of the options being granted. </p>"},"lifecycle":{"initialPublishDateTime":"2015-03-13T16:38:38Z","lastPublishDateTime":"2015-03-13T16:38:38Z"},"location":{"uri":"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/f2b13800-c70c-11e4-8e1f-00144feab7de.html"},"summary":{"excerpt":"Bonds, Aim stocks and shares can be in an Isa wrapper"},"packaging":{"kicker":"Isas 2015","spHeadline":"Consolidate other investments"},"master":{"masterSource":"Methode","masterEntityId":"f2b13800-c70c-11e4-8e1f-00144feab7de"},"editorial":{"otherTitles":["Isas 2015: Consolidate other investments"],"subheading":"Bonds, Aim stocks and shares can be in an Isa wrapper","standFirst":"Bonds, Aim stocks and shares can be in an Isa wrapper","byline":"Jonathan Eley"},"provenance":{"originatingParty":"FT"},"metadata":{"primarySection":{"term":{"name":"Personal Finance","id":"MTQw-U2VjdGlvbnM=","attributes":[],"taxonomy":"sections"}},"tags":[{"term":{"name":"Personal Finance","id":"MTQw-U2VjdGlvbnM=","attributes":[],"taxonomy":"sections"}},{"term":{"name":"News","id":"Nw==-R2VucmVz","attributes":[],"taxonomy":"genre"}},{"term":{"name":"Text","id":"ZjMwY2E2NjctMDA1Ni00ZTk4LWI0MWUtZjk5MTk2ZTMyNGVm-TWVkaWFUeXBlcw==","attributes":[],"taxonomy":"mediaType"}}],"authors":[{"term":{"name":"Jonathan Eley","id":"Q0ItMDAxNzEwMg==-QXV0aG9ycw==","attributes":[],"taxonomy":"authors"}}],"brand":[],"genre":[{"term":{"name":"News","id":"Nw==-R2VucmVz","attributes":[],"taxonomy":"genre"}}],"icb":[],"iptc":[{"term":{"name":"04006018 -
