The former chief executive of EDS who I was just talking to.”</p>\n<p>Pressed on who this was, Mr Balls said he was “a big supporter” but then admitted: “It has just gone from my head, which is a bit annoying at this time of night.” Labour officials said it was a simple human error.</p>\n<p>Mr Balls has attempted to win support in the City and business for Labour, but pro-business figures in the shadow cabinet, including Chuka Umunna, shadow business secretary, often feel their efforts are undercut by the tone towards business used by Mr Miliband.</p>\n<p>Digby Jones, a former minister in the last Labour government, said Mr Balls’ inability to name business supporters was a symptom of “a bigger problem” and that naming Mr Thomas as a big backer was “scraping the barrel”.</p>\n<p>“Business wants the mood music of this nation to be in favour of creating wealth,” Lord Jones told the BBC’s Today programme. “It’s about this concept that you’re not hearing from Ed Miliband — or Ed Balls — that creating wealth is a good thing.”</p>\n<p>Mr Balls has insisted that Labour is a centrist and pro-business party. Mr Miliband also points out that he would not put Britain’s EU membership in jeopardy, a cause of considerable business uncertainty, by holding a referendum on Britain leaving.</p>\n<a href=\"http://video.ft.com/4034485548001\"></a>\n\n\n</body>","title":"Business pressure on UK Labour party increases","byline":"George Parker","publishedDate":"2015-02-04T08:54:35.000Z","contentOrigin":{"originatingSystem":"http://www.ft.com/ontology/origin/FTComMethode","originatingIdentifier":"1525b8bc-ac45-11e4-af0e-00144feab7de"},"identifiers":[{"authority":"http://www.ft.com/ontology/origin/FTComMethode","identifierValue":"1525b8bc-ac45-11e4-af0e-00144feab7de"}],"requestUrl":"http://api.ft.com/content/1525b8bc-ac45-11e4-af0e-00144feab7de","brands":["http://api.ft.com/things/dbb0bdae-1f0c-11e4-b0cb-b2227cce2b54"],"webUrl":"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/1525b8bc-ac45-11e4-af0e-00144feab7de.html"}
