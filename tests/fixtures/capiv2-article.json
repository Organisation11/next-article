Back in 2011, it was gold miners. Before that, they fell briefly in love with Bric funds, which invest in Brazil, Russia, India and China. Earlier still, there were the technology funds, which boomed in popularity ahead of the early-2000s “tech wreck”.</p>\n<p>Many investors have done it: committed their Isa savings to a fashionable asset class whose narrative is so compelling, it seems impossible that the investment can fail. A few years later, when the<ft-content title=\"Gold miners struggle to shine in investors’ eyes - FT.com\" type=\"http://www.ft.com/ontology/content/Article\" url=\"http://api.ft.com/content/e88af396-8140-11e4-b956-00144feabdc0\"> gold price has fallen</ft-content> or <ft-content title=\"Russian hearts, minds and refrigerators - FT.com\" type=\"http://www.ft.com/ontology/content/Article\" url=\"http://api.ft.com/content/f30d3520-b5cc-11e4-b58d-00144feab7de\">Russia faces international sanctions</ft-content>, the story may look quite different.</p>\n<p>Of course, not all fashionable asset classes are doomed to decline in value, but for investors who have previously committed too high a proportion of their money to a fashionable fund or several, Isa season can provide an opportunity to spring clean your portfolio.</p>\n<p>More than half of the billions of pounds invested in the 10 most popular funds during the 2013 and 2014 Isa seasons went into products that then underperformed their sectors for the remainder of the year, according to Wealth Horizon, an online financial advice provider. The underperformers include funds in mainstream sectors such as UK equity income and property, as well as more esoteric asset classes.</p>\n<p>“Investors often hold just a handful of funds in their portfolio, which will invariably include some of the biggest and most popular funds, but a lot of these will disappoint investors,” said Chris Williams, chief executive of Wealth Horizon.</p>\n<p>He says that a “deluge of marketing material” around big-name fund managers and sectors is partly to blame for investors “putting all their eggs in one basket”.</p>\n<p>“It is essential that people select their investments on their own attitude to risk and take into account the volatility of the market, not simply base their investments on the popularity of funds.”</p>\n<p>Darius McDermott, managing director at Chelsea Financial Services, agrees: “There are armies of marketing people trying to invent a new ‘must have’ fund.”</p>\n<p>For investors regretting their past choices, he notes that selling under certain specific circumstances could be unwise. “For example, most UK funds have performed very strongly since the global financial crisis; had you sold at the bottom you would have crystallised heavy losses.”</p>\n<p>Investors should look out for “mitigating circumstances such as a major market crash” and should compare a fund with its peer group, Mr McDermott adds, but “if any fund underperforms its sector average over a three-year time period, it is time to sell”.</p>\n<p>Buying and selling funds, or switching providers, usually incurs fees, but the good news is that you can switch between funds or Isa managers without losing the tax protection on the assets or eating into the current year’s allowance.</p>\n<p>For those investors looking for an all-round fresh start, one option is low-cost portfolios of passive funds, such as those offered by Wealth Horizon, Nutmeg and other online investment firms. These are linked to investors’ risk appetite and are periodically rebalanced. Other providers, such as Money on Toast, offer similar portfolios but include active funds in asset classes such as property, which can be harder to access passively.</p>\n<p>Surrendering asset allocation decisions to an expert — something you can also do by buying a <ft-content title=\"Multi-asset funds promise all-in-one toolkit - FT.com\" type=\"http://www.ft.com/ontology/content/Article\" url=\"http://api.ft.com/content/b1eb27de-6f2a-11e4-b060-00144feabdc0\">multi-asset </ft-content>or multi-manager fund — should help to ensure that you do not hold too much of one asset class.</p>\n<p>If you want to retain control over your investments, however, many self-directed investment platforms offer access to “model portfolios” of passive or active funds or both. These suggest a mix of funds according to risk appetite, and will often send you updates when the portfolio needs rebalancing. This can serve as a useful starting point, while allowing each investor to adapt the suggestions they are given.</p>\n<p>If you are still tempted to invest some of your money in a highly specialised fund, make sure that you do not commit too high a proportion of your cash; also check that its risk levels fit with your own risk appetite, and that you understand what it does. “A golden rule is if you don’t understand a business, don’t invest in it,” says Mr McDermott.</p>\n<p>Another risk is that the fund reflects a good idea but is badly timed. “Trendy renewable ideas such as solar manufacturers or climate change funds have run aground in recent times. Thematic funds can in some cases be a good investment, but be careful, as sometimes they are way ahead of their time,” Mr McDermott says.</p>\n</body>","title":"Clean up your portfolio","byline":"Judith Evans","publishedDate":"2015-03-13T16:37:13.000Z","contentOrigin":{"originatingSystem":"http://api.ft.com/system/FTCOM-METHODE","originatingIdentifier":"c3731632-c656-11e4-a13d-00144feab7de"},"identifiers":[{"authority":"http://api.ft.com/system/FTCOM-METHODE","identifierValue":"c3731632-c656-11e4-a13d-00144feab7de"}],"requestUrl":"http://api.ft.com/content/c3731632-c656-11e4-a13d-00144feab7de","brands":["http://api.ft.com/things/dbb0bdae-1f0c-11e4-b0cb-b2227cce2b54"],"mainImage":{"id":"http://api.ft.com/content/15c45a94-5371-11e4-1ce3-978e959e1c97"},"webUrl":"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/c3731632-c656-11e4-a13d-00144feab7de.html"}
