## Known issues

### Images don't load

In order for images to load you need to be using a subdomain of `ft.com`.  For localhost development, the recommendation is mapping `localhost.ft.com` to `127.0.0.1`.  It will be broken on herokuapp.com for now.  Track the progress of the underlying issue here:- https://redmine.labs.ft.com/issues/48232.
